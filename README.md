# Breiman_vs_Shmuell-
Comparison between Breiman (2003) and Shmueli (2010) articles on Predictive vs Explanatory Models

Breiman and Shmueli both address the nature of modeling.  Both authors examine the components of “predictive” models and explore “explanatory” or causal models.  While the authors sometimes use slightly different terminology, both authors see predictive models as having the goal of algorithmically forecasting outcomes with the greatest accuracy.  The exact causal explanation for why the result is occurring is less, but not necessarily entirely, unimportant.  On the other hand dor explanatory models, the theory and causal explanation is the most critical goal.
